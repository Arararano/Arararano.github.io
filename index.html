            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> Hey!! I'm Arno, a student persuing my BS in CS. <br><br>

                I love playing games and reading books. I also love linux, programming, math and other related fields. I upload myself programming every day on my youtube channel. <br><br>

                I've been using Arch for about 2 years now and recently switched my desktop over from windows aswell. I was drawn in by the creativity and expressiveness of the operating system, and I loved the look of i3. Growing up I used to write scripts for CheatEngine to give me and my sisters infinite gems in CookingFever, and ever since then I've been very attached to computers. I've been programming for 3 years now, primarily in Python, Java and Rust, although recently I've taken an interest in learning C and Go.<br><br>

                In terms of games I mostly play on my computer with my friends, some of my favorite games include 
                <span><ul>
                    <li>Terraira</li>
                    <li>Factorio</li>
                    <li>Overwatch</li>
                    <li>Hollow Knight</li>
                </ul></span>
                But I mostly play a bizzare selection of small studio indie games
