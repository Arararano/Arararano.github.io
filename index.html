        <div class="box-content"><span><p>Hey!! I'm Arno, a student pursuing my BS in CS. <br><br>

          I love playing games and reading books. I also love linux, programming, math and other related fields. I upload myself programming every day on my youtube channel. <br><br>

          I've been using Arch for about 2 years now and recently switched my desktop over from windows aswell. I was drawn in by the creativity and expressiveness of the operating system, and I loved the look of i3. Growing up I used to write scripts for Cheat Engine to give me and my sisters infinite gems in Cooking Fever. I've been programming for 3 years now, primarily in Python, Java, and Rust, although recently I've taken an interest in learning C and Go.<br><br>
         
          I love building systems or software that I can use in my daily life, and I often find other people who build these types of things out of passion very inspiring. I really enjoy the youtuber JVscholz and his focus on being intentional about how you spend your time. <br><br>

          This past year I've adopted the habit of reading daily, if you have any book reccomendations feel free to reach out and let me know! I have recently enjoyed reading productivity books as well as books with related themes, and I've also recently finished book 4 of the Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson.
